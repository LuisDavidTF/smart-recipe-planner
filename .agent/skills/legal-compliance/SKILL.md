## 1. Compliance Checklist

Before finalizing a feature or merging to `main`, run this audit:

### A. Data Protection (Privacy Policy)
1. **Minimization**: Are we collecting ONLY necessary data?
2. **Consent**: Do new forms/cookies require explicit user consent?
3. **Storage**: Is sensitive data (PII) stored securely?
   - *Check*: No PII in `localStorage` without encryption?
   - *Check*: No logging of passwords or tokens in console/server logs?
4. **ARCO Rights**: Does the user have a way to Delete/Modify this new data?
   - *Example*: If adding `pantryItems`, can the user delete them? (Yes/No)

### B. Terms & Conditions (Liability)
1. **AI Disclaimers**: If adding AI features, is the "AS IS" / "Verification Required" disclaimer visible?
2. **User generated content**: If users upload images/text, is the "Rights & Responsibility" clause visible?
3. **Age Verification**: Does the new feature allow restricted access to minors without checks?

## 2. Mandatory Verification Steps

When running this skill, you must verifying the following files:

1. `context/SettingsContext.js` -> Ensure translations for disclaimers exist.
2. `lib/db.ts` or Database Schema -> Ensure no unconsented tracking fields.
3. `middleware.ts` / `headers` -> Ensure Security Headers (CSP, HSTS) are maintained.

## 3. Audit Report Format

If requested, generate a brief report:
